                    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
                    <p>
                        Throughout my career, I’ve developed strong interpersonal and organizational skills through roles in client services, customer relations, and retail. These experiences have taught me the importance of teamwork, adaptability, and providing exceptional service. Whether consulting clients at J2 Tanning Salon or assisting guests at Tanglewood Golf Course, I’ve always prioritized building positive relationships and exceeding expectations.

                    <h2>Courses and Skills Development</h2>
                    <p>
                        My coursework in Information Science and Business has equipped me with valuable skills in data analysis, website development, and project management. I’ve built proficiency in tools like Python and Microsoft Office while honing critical thinking through real-world applications. I also had the opportunity to learn basic web design skills through my into to web design class, and I am planning on refining these skills by taking a more advanced web design class in the future! These classes have strengthened my ability to analyze complex problems and deliver creative solutions.

                    <p>
                        As a proud member of Alpha Phi, I’ve participated in numerous community service initiatives and fundraising efforts. These experiences have helped me grow as a leader and a team player while fostering a sense of connection and purpose. Being part of this organization has not only enriched my college experience but also deepened my commitment to giving back.

                    <p>
                        I’m actively involved in the Michigan State Corporate Retail Association, where I’ve gained insights into the retail industry and expanded my professional network. These extracurriculars, along with my commitment to personal development, have taught me the value of collaboration and continuous learning. While balancing my coursework, jobs, and extracurricular activities, I have learned how to effectivley manage my time and prioritize things that are important to me.
